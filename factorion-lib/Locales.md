# Factorion Locale Format
Factorion uses a versioned Locale format for backwards compatibility, it is recommended to use the most up-to-date version.
Locales can theoretically be supplied in any format, the specific bot supports, but preferred and supported by official bots is JSON.

Here listed is the English locale in all versions, with comments explaining the settings.
Locales contain a few different kinds of settings:
- Simple text
- Templated text, where some "{template}" (like "{factorial}") is replaced by other text
- Character, a text that is only one character long (like "." or ",")
- Toggles: on is true, off is false
- Map, a list of key value pairs for certain settings, used for overrides
